Flexible Structural Alignment \+: Flexible protein alignment by a method of hierarchical segmentation

A reccurent issue in structural alignment is to compare protein in the same folding family with different conformations. In fact, proteins are not rigid body.

In this method, a protein is cut into Protein Units (P\+Us) and these P\+Us are aligned on the second protein and conversely. These P\+Us are produced by the {\itshape Protein Peeling} algorithm. Then, for each cutting, these P\+Us are aligned and a T\+Mscore is calculated by T\+Malign.

To compare this method to others, T\+Malign, a classic rigid algorithm, is implemented and par\+M\+A\+TT, a flexible algorithm, too.

\subsection*{Install and execute}

To install it, first install all the requiered module with correct version with this command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{DoxyCode}


Then, it\textquotesingle{}s possible to run the programm with this command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./main.py -i <file> -c <chain1> -f <file2> -d <chain2>
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Running the test}

For this program, a benchmark is given and saved in data folder. If you want to test it you can use this command \+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./bench.py
\end{DoxyCode}
